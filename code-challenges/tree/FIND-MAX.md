# Challenge Summary
Find max value in a bianry tree

## Challenge Description
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
I first checked the value of the root and made max equal that value, then I checked each branch for a larger number and reassigned max any time it was smaller than the value being checked. Big O O(n)
