# Challenge Summary
Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge Description
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
I traversed the tree using the breadth-first approach and returned the values in an array, after putting through a queue. I believe this is an O(n), since it has to traverse the entire tree.
