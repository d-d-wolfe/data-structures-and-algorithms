# Challenge Summary
Tree intersection

## Challenge Description
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a for loop to iterate over the values and push the intersecting values into an array.

Big O = O(n) time
        O(1) space
