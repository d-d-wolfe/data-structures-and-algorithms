# Singly Linked List
Create a linked list and traverse it, add nodes to it, and find functions.

## Challenge
 - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

- Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

- Define a method called append which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- Define a method called insertBefore which adds a new node with the given newValue before the first value node

- Define a method called insertAfter which adds a new node with the given newValue after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
