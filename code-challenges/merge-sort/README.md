# Challenge Summary
Write a function called mergeSort which sorts an array by using merge sorting.

## Challenge Description
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency
Approach: Split the array into seperate parts, determine which ones are larger or smaller, and put the parts back in the correct order.

Big O = O(n^n)
