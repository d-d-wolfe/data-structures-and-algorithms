# Challenge Summary
Depth First Graph Traversal

# Acknowledgement

- Thank you Marlene Rinker for your help

## Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a class with a method that performs a depth frist traversal of a graph. Wrote tests to verify.

`traverseDepthFirst` traverses the graph using a depth-first approace and return the values in a set. 

time = O(n) because it goes through the entire graph
space = O(1) because it takes no extra space
