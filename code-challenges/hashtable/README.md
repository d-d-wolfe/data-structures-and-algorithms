# Hashtables
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

1. `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
